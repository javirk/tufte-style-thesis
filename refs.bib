	abstract     = {The objective quantification of retinal atrophy associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is required for clinical diagnosis, follow-up, treatment efficacy evaluation, and clinical research. Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become an essential imaging technology to evaluate the macula. This paper describes a novel automatic method for the identification and quantification of atrophy associated with AMD in OCT scans and its visualization in the corresponding infrared imaging (IR) image. The method is based on the classification of light scattering patterns in vertical pixel-wide columns (A-scans) in OCT slices (B-scans) in which atrophy appears with a custom column-based convolutional neural network (CNN). The network classifies individual columns with 3D column patches formed by adjacent neighboring columns from the volumetric OCT scan. Subsequent atrophy columns form atrophy segments which are then projected onto the IR image and are used to identify and segment atrophy lesions in the IR image and to measure their areas and distances from the fovea. Experimental results on 106 clinical OCT scans (5,207 slices) in which cRORA atrophy (the end point of advanced dry AMD) was identified in 2,952 atrophy segments and 1,046 atrophy lesions yield a mean F1 score of 0.78 (std 0.06) and an AUC of 0.937, both close to the observer variability. Automated computer-based detection and quantification of atrophy associated with AMD using a column-based CNN classification in OCT scans can be performed at expert level and may be a useful clinical decision support and research tool for the diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of retinal degenerations and dystrophies.},

	abstract     = {Transfer learning is a standard technique to improve performance on tasks with limited data. However, for medical imaging, the value of transfer learning is less clear. This is likely due to the large domain mismatch between the usual natural-image pre-training (e.g. ImageNet) and medical images. However, recent advances in transfer learning have shown substantial improvements from scale. We investigate whether modern methods can change the fortune of transfer learning for medical imaging. For this, we study the class of large-scale pre-trained networks presented by Kolesnikov et al. on three diverse imaging tasks: chest radiography, mammography, and dermatology. We study both transfer performance and critical properties for the deployment in the medical domain, including: out-of-distribution generalization, data-efficiency, sub-group fairness, and uncertainty estimation. Interestingly, we find that for some of these properties transfer from natural to medical images is indeed extremely effective, but only when performed at sufficient scale.},

	abstract     = {Do visual tasks have a relationship, or are they unre-lated? For instance, could having surface normals simplify estimating the depth of an image? Intuition answers these questions positively, implying existence of a structure among visual tasks. Knowing this structure has notable values ; it is the concept underlying transfer learning and provides a principled way for identifying redundancies across tasks, e.g., to seamlessly reuse supervision among related tasks or solve many tasks in one system without piling up the complexity. We proposes a fully computational approach for model-ing the structure of space of visual tasks. This is done via finding (first and higher-order) transfer learning dependencies across a dictionary of twenty six 2D, 2.5D, 3D, and semantic tasks in a latent space. The product is a computational taxonomic map for task transfer learning. We study the consequences of this structure, e.g. nontrivial emerged relationships, and exploit them to reduce the demand for labeled data. For example, we show that the total number of labeled datapoints needed for solving a set of 10 tasks can be reduced by roughly 2 3 (compared to training independently) while keeping the performance nearly the same. We provide a set of tools for computing and probing this taxo-nomical structure including a solver that users can employ to devise efficient supervision policies for their use cases.},

	abstract     = {Background and Objective: Computer aided diagnosis systems based on deep learning and medical imaging is increasingly becoming research hotspots. At the moment, the classical convolutional neural network generates classification results by hierarchically abstracting the original image. These abstract features are less sensitive to the position and orientation of the object, and this lack of spatial information limits the further improvement of image classification accuracy. Therefore, how to develop a suitable neural network framework and training strategy in practical clinical applications to avoid this problem is a topic that researchers need to continue to explore. Methods: We propose a deep learning framework that combines residual thought and dilated convolution to diagnose and detect childhood pneumonia. Specifically, based on an understanding of the nature of the child pneumonia image classification task, the proposed method uses the residual structure to overcome the over-fitting and the degradation problems of the depth model, and utilizes dilated convolution to overcome the problem of loss of feature space information caused by the increment in depth of the model. Furthermore, in order to overcome the problem of difficulty in training model due to insufficient data and the negative impact of the introduction of structured noise on the performance of the model, we use the model parameters learned on large-scale datasets in the same field to initialize our model through transfer learning. Results: Our proposed method has been evaluated for extracting texture features associated with pneumonia and for accurately identifying the performance of areas of the image that best indicate pneumonia. The experimental results of the test dataset show that the recall rate of the method on children pneumonia classification task is 96.7{\%}, and the f1-score is 92.7{\%}. Compared with the prior art methods, this approach can effectively solve the problem of low image resolution and partial occlusion of the inflammatory area in children chest X-ray images. Conclusions: The novel framework focuses on the application of advanced classification that directly performs lesion characterization, and has high reliability in the classification task of children pneumonia.},

Theoretical and experimental results illustrate the usefulness of the method for such problems as the experimental optimization of the performance of a system with a very general multipeak performance function when the only available information is noise-distributed samples of the function. At present, its usefulness is restricted to optimization with respect to one system parameter. The observations are taken sequentially; but, as opposed to the gradient method, the observation may be located anywhere on the parameter interval. A sequence of estimates of the location of the curve maximum is generated. The location of the next observation may be interpreted as the location of the most likely competitor (with the current best estimate) for the location of the curve maximum. A Brownian motion stochastic process is selected as a model for the unknown function, and the observations are interpreted with respect to the model. The model gives the results a simple intuitive interpretation and allows the use of simple but efficient sampling procedures. The resulting process possesses some powerful convergence properties in the presence of noise; it is nonparametric and, despite its generality, is efficient in the use of observations. The approach seems quite promising as a solution to many of the problems of experimental system optimization.}

	abstract     = {Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is receiving great attention due to its low human annotation cost. In this paper, we aim to tackle bounding box supervised semantic segmentation, i.e., training accurate semantic segmentation models using bounding box annotations as supervision. To this end, we propose Affinity Attention Graph Neural Network (A 2 GNN). Following previous practices, we first generate pseudo semantic-aware seeds, which are then formed into semantic graphs based on our newly proposed affinity Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then the built graphs are input to our A 2 GNN, in which an affinity attention layer is designed to acquire the short-and long-distance information from soft graph edges to accurately propagate semantic labels from the confident seeds to the unlabeled pixels. However, to guarantee the precision of the seeds, we only adopt a limited number of confident pixel seed labels for A 2 GNN, which may lead to insufficient supervision for training. To alleviate this issue, we further introduce a new loss function and a consistency-checking mechanism to leverage the bounding box constraint, so that more reliable guidance can be included for the model optimization. Experiments show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performances on Pascal VOC 2012 datasets (val: 76.5{\%}, test: 75.2{\%}). More importantly, our approach can be readily applied to bounding box supervised instance segmentation task or other weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks, with state-of-the-art or comparable performance among almot all weakly supervised tasks on PASCAL VOC or COCO dataset.

Our technique correctly produces bounding-boxes in 50{\%}of the images, while reducing the total annotation time by factor 6.8{\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}} compared to drawing bounding-boxes.

	abstract     = {Transfer learning has been an important ingredient of state-of-the-art deep learning models. In particular, it has significant impact when little data is available for the target task, such as in many medical imaging applications. Typically, transfer learning means pre-training the target model on a related task which has sufficient data available. However, often pre-trained models from several related tasks are available, and it would be desirable to transfer their combined knowledge by automatic weighting and merging. For this reason, we propose T-IMM (Transfer Incremental Mode Matching), a method to leverage several pre-trained models, which extends the concept of Incremental Mode Matching from lifelong learning to the transfer learning setting. Our method introduces layer wise mixing ratios, which are learned automatically and fuse multiple pre-trained models before fine-tuning on the new task. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by the example of brain tumor segmentation in MRI (BRATS 2018 Challange). We show that fusing weights according to our framework, merging two models trained on general brain parcellation can greatly enhance the final model performance for small training sets when compared to standard transfer methods or state-of the art initialization. We further demonstrate that the benefit remains even when training on the entire Brats 2018 data set (255 patients).},

	abstract     = {Transfer learning from natural image datasets, particularly IMAGENET, using standard large models and corresponding pretrained weights has become a de-facto method for deep learning applications to medical imaging. However, there are fundamental differences in data sizes, features and task specifications between natural image classification and the target medical tasks, and there is little understanding of the effects of transfer. In this paper, we explore properties of transfer learning for medical imaging. A performance evaluation on two large scale medical imaging tasks shows that surprisingly, transfer offers little benefit to performance, and simple, lightweight models can perform comparably to IMAGENET architectures. Investigating the learned representations and features, we find that some of the differences from transfer learning are due to the over-parametrization of standard models rather than sophisticated feature reuse. We isolate where useful feature reuse occurs, and outline the implications for more efficient model exploration. We also explore feature independent benefits of transfer arising from weight scalings.},

	abstract     = {Attention-based neural networks such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) have recently attained state-of-the-art results on many computer vision benchmarks. Scale is a primary ingredient in attaining excellent results, therefore, understanding a model's scaling properties is a key to designing future generations effectively. While the laws for scaling Transformer language models have been studied, it is unknown how Vision Transformers scale. To address this, we scale ViT models and data, both up and down, and characterize the relationships between error rate, data, and compute. Along the way, we refine the architecture and training of ViT, reducing memory consumption and increasing accuracy the resulting models. As a result, we successfully train a ViT model with two billion parameters, which attains a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet of 90.45{\%} top-1 accuracy. The model also performs well on few-shot learning, for example, attaining 84.86{\%} top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 10 examples per class.},

Materials and Methods Prospective 18F-FDG PET brain images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (2109 imaging studies from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective independent test set (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were collected. Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional neural network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90{\%} of ADNI data set and tested on the remaining 10{\%}, as well as the independent test set, with performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), saliency map, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results The algorithm achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated on predicting the final clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set (82{\%} specificity at 100{\%} sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57{\%} [four of seven] sensitivity, 91{\%} [30 of 33] specificity; P {\textless} .05). Saliency map demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with focus on the entire brain. Conclusion By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer disease achieved 82{\%} specificity at 100{\%} sensitivity, an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

	abstract     = {Weakly supervised learning attempts to construct predictive models by learning with weak supervision. In this paper, we concentrate on weakly supervised object localization and semantic segmentation tasks. Existing methods are limited to focusing on narrow discriminative parts or overextending the activations to less discriminative regions even on backgrounds. To mitigate these problems, we regard the background as an important cue that guides the feature activation to cover the entire object to the right extent, and propose two novel objective functions: 1) contrastive attention loss and 2) foreground consistency loss. Contrastive attention loss draws the foreground feature and its dropped version close together and pushes the dropped foreground feature away from the background feature. Foreground consistency loss favors agreement between layers and provides early layers with a sense of objectness. Using both losses leads to balanced improvements over localization and segmentation accuracy by boosting activations on less discriminative regions but restraining the activation in the target object extent. For better optimizing the above losses, we use the non-local attention blocks to replace channel-pooled attention leading to enhanced attention maps considering the spatial similarity. Finally, our method achieves state-of-the-art localization performance on CUB-200-2011, ImageNet, and OpenImages benchmarks regarding top-1 localization accuracy, MaxBoxAccV2, and PxAP. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving segmentation performance measured by mIoU on the PASCAL VOC dataset.},

A simple form of transfer learning is common in current state-of-the-art computer vision models, i.e. pre-training a model for image classification on the ILSVRC dataset, and then fine-tune on any target task. However, previous systematic studies of transfer learning have been limited and the circumstances in which it is expected to work are not fully understood. In this paper we carry out an extensive experimental exploration of transfer learning across vastly different image domains (consumer photos, autonomous driving, aerial imagery, underwater, indoor scenes, synthetic, close-ups) and task types (semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, keypoint detection). Importantly, these are all complex, structured output tasks types relevant to modern computer vision applications. In total we carry out over 1200 transfer experiments, including many where the source and target come from different image domains, task types, or both. We systematically analyze these experiments to understand the impact of image domain, task type, and dataset size on transfer learning performance. Our study leads to several insights and concrete recommendations for practitioners.},

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.},

The paper explores the possibility of extrapolating a high-dimensional function using multiple one-dimensional converging lines. The main idea is to select samples along lines towards the inaccessible point. Multi-dimensional extrapolation is thus transformed into a series of one-dimensional extrapolations that provide multiple estimates at the inaccessible point. We demonstrate the performance of converging lines using Kriging to extrapolate a two-dimensional drag coefficient function. Post-processing of extrapolation results from different lines based on Bayesian theory is proposed to combine the multiple predictions. Selection of lines is also discussed. The method of converging lines proves to be more robust and reliable than two-dimensional Kriging surrogate for the example.}

Detailed per-pixel annotations enable training accurate models but are very time-consuming to obtain; image-level class labels are an order of magnitude cheaper but result in less accurate models. We take a natural step from image-level annotation towards stronger supervision: we ask annotators to point to an object if one exists. We incorporate this point supervision along with a novel objectness potential in the training loss function of a CNN model. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark reveal that the combined effect of point-level supervision and objectness potential yields an improvement of {\$}{\$}12.9{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}mIOU over image-level supervision. Further, we demonstrate that models trained with point-level supervision are more accurate than models trained with image-level, squiggle-level or full supervision given a fixed annotation budget.}

	abstract     = {Modern deep learning systems require huge data sets to achieve impressive performance, but there is little guidance on how much or what kind of data to collect. Over-collecting data incurs unnecessary present costs, while under-collecting may incur future costs and delay workflows. We propose a new paradigm for modeling the data collection workflow as a formal optimal data collection problem that allows designers to specify performance targets, collection costs, a time horizon, and penalties for failing to meet the targets. Additionally, this formulation generalizes to tasks requiring multiple data sources, such as labeled and unlabeled data used in semi-supervised learning. To solve our problem, we develop Learn-Optimize-Collect (LOC), which minimizes expected future collection costs. Finally, we numerically compare our framework to the conventional baseline of estimating data requirements by extrapolating from neural scaling laws. We significantly reduce the risks of failing to meet desired performance targets on several classification, segmentation, and detection tasks, while maintaining low total collection costs.}

	abstract     = {Given a small training data set and a learning algorithm , how much more data is necessary to reach a target validation or test performance? This question is of critical importance in applications such as autonomous driving or medical imaging where collecting data is expensive and time-consuming. Overestimating or underestimating data requirements incurs substantial costs that could be avoided with an adequate budget. Prior work on neural scaling laws suggest that the power-law function can fit the validation performance curve and extrapolate it to larger data set sizes. We find that this does not immediately translate to the more difficult downstream task of estimating the required data set size to meet a target performance. In this work, we consider a broad class of computer vision tasks and systematically investigate a family of functions that generalize the power-law function to allow for better estimation of data requirements. Finally, we show that incorporating a tuned correction factor and collecting over multiple rounds significantly improves the performance of the data estimators. Using our guidelines, practitioners can accurately estimate data requirements of machine learning systems to gain savings in both development time and data acquisition costs.}

	abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been recently employed to solve problems from both the computer vision and medical image analysis fields. Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.},

pages="29--53",
abstract="In this chapter, I show that priors over network parameters can be defined in such a way that the corresponding priors over functions computed by the network reach reasonable limits as the number of hidden units goes to infinity. When using such priors,there is thus no need to limit the size of the network in order to avoid ``overfitting''. The infinite network limit also provides insight into the properties of different priors. A Gaussian prior for hidden-to-output weights results in a Gaussian process prior for functions,which may be smooth, Brownian, or fractional Brownian. Quite different effects can be obtained using priors based on non-Gaussian stable distributions. In networks with more than one hidden layer, a combination of Gaussian and non-Gaussian priors appears most interesting.",

This tradition continues with the new Fifth Edition, which has been completely revised and updated to describe our current, rapidly advancing understanding of cell biology. To list but a few examples, a large amount of new material is presented on epigenetics; stem cells; RNAi; comparative genomics; the latest cancer therapies; apoptosis (now its own separate chapter); and cell cycle control and the mechanics of M phase (now integrated into one chapter). The hallmark features of Molecular Biology of the Cell have been retained, such as its consistent and comprehensive art program, clear concept headings, and succinct section summaries. By skillfully extracting the fundamental concepts from this enormous and ever-growing field, the authors tell the story of cell biology, and thereby create a coherent framework through which readers may approach and enjoy this subject that is so central to all of biology.},
