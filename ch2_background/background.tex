\subsubsection{Synopsis} This chapter examines the field of computer vision, with a specific focus on applications in ophthalmology. It begins with an introduction to machine learning in vision, highlighting deep neural networks and other concepts such as feature extraction or evaluation metrics. Next, attention mechanisms and vision transformers are explored, examining their efficacy compared to traditional convolutional networks, particularly in medical imaging. This opens the field to discuss novel training procedures distinct from those traditionally used for convolutional networks. Before looking into training strategies for machine learning, Gaussian processes and regression are briefly overviewed. Then, domain adaptation in computer vision is addressed, explaining its real-world significance and different types. Finally, attention turns to ophthalmology, covering some technical aspects of retinal imaging using optical coherence tomography (OCT), the identification of pathologies through these imaging techniques, and the concept of biological markers. The chapter concludes by discussing the integration of deep learning and ophthalmology.

% This chapter examines the field of computer vision, with a specific focus on applications in ophthalmology. We begin with an introduction to machine learning in vision, highlighting deep neural networks and other concepts such as feature extraction or evaluation metrics. Next, we explore attention mechanisms and vision transformers, examining their efficacy compared to traditional convolutional networks, particularly in medical imaging. This opens the field to discuss novel training procedures distinct from those traditionally used for convolutional networks. Before looking into training strategies for machine learning, we briefly stop to overview Gaussian processes and regression. Then, we address domain adaptation in computer vision, explaining its real-world significance and different types. Finally, we turn our attention to ophthalmology, covering some technical aspects of retinal imaging using optical coherence tomography (OCT), the identification of pathologies through these imaging techniques, and the concept of biological markers. The chapter concludes by discussing the integration of deep learning and ophthalmology.
