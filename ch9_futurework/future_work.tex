\subsubsection{Synopsis} It is difficult to predict the future of a scientific discipline. One can foresee future lines of work from a right assessment of the current methods and theories' limitations or from bridging two fields. By critically evaluating the existing methodologies, we can identify the gaps and challenges that must be addressed to advance the field. This assessment provides a roadmap for future research, highlighting areas where incremental improvements can lead to significant breakthroughs. In this section, I will dive into the limitations of the methods outlined in the dissertation. Then, I will allow for some mind-wandering that will take me to venture into potential bridges that might be interesting to pursue.
