\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a method to locate markers in ETDRS rings for OCT scans by relying solely on slice-level annotations. By enforcing weak constraints on the loss function and modifying the pooling strategy of a standard convolutional network, we show that our method can learn to localize coarsely without annotations. To our knowledge, no other work has done so in the context of retinal imaging, and we have demonstrated that our approach achieves significant performance improvements over straightforward and state-of-the-art baselines. Further research will be focused on extending this to obtain per-pixel segmentation.
