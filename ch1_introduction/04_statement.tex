\section{Thesis Statement}
The goal of this dissertation is to address the previous challenges from different perspectives, considering the machine learning pipeline as a set of parts that can be optimized in terms of data efficiency. As discussed above, the data challenges are particularly severe in vision tasks applied to the medical domain, where the amount of data is even more limited due to the necessity of expert annotators. We will, therefore, focus on the medical domain. This leads to the following thesis statement:

\textit{The surging demand for larger datasets, which is promoted by ever-larger models and the advancements in computing, can be counteracted by making informed labeling choices, carefully allocating the budget, and leveraging field-specific constraints to the model's advantage.}
