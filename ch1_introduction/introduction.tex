% Sections: 
%Data Challenges in Computer Vision
%   Understanding the Challenge of Limited Data: talk about the evolution of data with respect to model size
%   Implications for Computer Vision Tasks: performance, generalization, data efficiency (methods that maximize the given data), robustness (look at wrong patterns)

%Overcoming Data Constraints
%   Importance of Data Augmentation and Synthesis: the first part is ok, the second maybe I remove

%   Domain Adaptation: talk about what it is, types, history and examples

% Overcoming Budget Constraints
%   Weak annotations
%   Adaptive Annotation strategies
%   Active Learning: Not sure, it can be a very short part

%Thesis Statement: all the other subsections can be removed I guess
%%   Identifying Challenges in Data-Scarce Environments

\subsubsection{Synopsis}AI and computer vision have benefited from rapid advances in technology and computing power, but these advances also present significant data challenges. As AI models become larger and more complex, their energy requirements and the need for extensive datasets increase. This poses two major hurdles: the environmental impact of training large models and the difficulty of acquiring high-quality training data due to both size and budget. Data scarcity can lead to problems with model generalization, resulting in performance issues when AI systems are deployed in real-world scenarios. This has led to the development of several techniques that aim to mitigate the need for data by extracting as much information as possible from coarse labels.
