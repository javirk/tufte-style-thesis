\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to determine a dynamic annotation strategy for building segmentation datasets. We design an iterative process that identifies efficient dataset-specific combinations of weak annotations in the form of image-level labels and full segmentations. We show in our experiments that the best strategies are often dataset and budget-dependent, and therefore the trivial approaches do not always produce the best results. Our method however is capable of adapting to different image domains and finds combinations of annotations that reach high-performance levels. We show our method is robust to a number of hyperparameters and that it offers a good option for allocating annotation strategies.
